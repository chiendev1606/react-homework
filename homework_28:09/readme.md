### Homework 28/09/2024

## Coin

**Acceptance criteria:**

[x] “Your coin balance”, at the bottom of the page, should update to show the value of `numOfCoins`.
[x] Clicking the coin should increment this value by 2 (since it's a $2 coin).

## Shopping list

**Acceptance Criteria:**

[x] The shown list of items should be driven from React state. We can remove the placeholder foods, and start with an empty list
[x] Submitting the form should add a new item to the list, and show it in the UI
[x] When submitting the form, the text input should be reset, so that it's empty. This way, users can easily add multiple items without having to erase their previous entry.
[x] There should be no “key” warnings in the console. Ideally, you **shouldn't** use the index for the key.
